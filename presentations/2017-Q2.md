# [fit] API

---

the knobs and levers by which humans control their packages

---

things like:

```
npm team add npmcorp:developers chrisdickinson
curl -sL http://registry.npmjs.org/-/all
curl -sL http://registry.npmjs.org/-/_view/dependedUpon
curl -sL http://registry.npmjs.org/-/v1/hooks
npm owner add npm-registry-client chrisdickinson
npm info browserify
```
