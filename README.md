# :package: :ledger: the npm registry documentation repo

## What This Repo Is

If there are major releases going out, we will write them up here.

We will collect documentation about API endpoints here.

:white_check_mark: If you are having issues with the registry — a publish is
too slow, or if you can't install a package you know exists — **please
report that in the [support category on npm.community](https://npm.community/c/support) **.  If the
topic is sensitive, please [contact npm's support staff](https://www.npmjs.com/support).

:white_check_mark: If you need something from the registry — a new API, or new information in an
existing API — **please post that to the [ideas category](https://npm.community/c/ideas)**.

If you're looking for issues that were previously located here, please see
the [npm registry issue archive](https://github.com/npm/registry-issue-archive).
